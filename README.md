# odin-recipes #

## What this project is about ##

At first this project will be a basic page of food recipes and I will try to improve it the further I go into Odin.

### What am I expecting to learn? ###

I aim to deepen my knowledge on HTML and understand Git better. Another thing I want to understand better with this project is when to do each commit and learn how to make them with the best practices in mind. 


Recipes made to suit all tastes!!
