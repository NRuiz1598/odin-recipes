# odin-recipes #

## What this project is about ##

At first this project will be a basic page of food recipes and I will try to improve it the further I go into Odin.

### What am I expecting to learn? ###

My aim is to deepen my knowledge on HTML and understand Git better. Another thing I want to understand better with this project is when to do each commit and learn how to make them with the best practices in mind. 


### What did I learn? ###

I became more familiar with git, its commands and most importantly commits, also I had to use alot the linux terminal so I became more used to using it compared to when I start Odin.

Recipes made to suit all tastes!!
